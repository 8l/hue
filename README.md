# Hue

A functional programming language.

I'm just having some fun. This is by no means the futurez of programming, brogramming or anything like that (except it will be renamed to skynet in 2018 and take over the world, but more on that later).

- Everything is an expression
- Values are immutable (can't be modified)
- Fully Unicode (Text type is UTF-32, source files are interpreted as UTF-8 and language symbols can be almost any Unicode character).
- Fast JIT compiler
- Close to the metal â€” built on top of LLVM and thus compiles down to highly optimized machine code that's so fast it makes your mama faint
- Neat codebase with clearly separated components
  - Tokenizer: Reads UTF-8 encoded text and streams Hue language tokens.
  - Parser: Reads Hue language tokens and streams Hue language structures.
  - Transformer: Reads Reads Hue language structures (AST) and transforms the code (i.e. finalizes incomplete function types and infers expression result values).
  - Compiler ("codegen"): Reads Hue language structures (AST) and streams LLVM structures.
  - Runtime library: Provides a few select features like stdio access
- Features an immutable persistent vector implementation inspired by Clojure that's pretty darn fast (almost constant time complexity.)

## Examples

A classic example of a recursive procedure is the function used to calculate the factorial of a natural number. When compiled with optimizations in Hue, this becomes a true tail recursive function.

    factorial = func (n Int) if n == 0 1 else n * factorial n - 1
    factorial 10  # -> 3628800

The well known mathematical recursive function that computes the Nth Fibonacci number:

    fib = func (n Int)
      if n < 2
        n
      else
        (fib n-1) + fib n-2

    fib 32  # -> 2178309

Have a look at the tests in the `test` directory for more examples.

## Building

First, you need to grab and build llvm. See `deps/llvm/README` for details.

Then, it's all just regular make:

    $ make

Should give you some stuff in the `build` subdirectory.

## bin/hue

The `hue` program is a all-in-one tool which is essentially a JIT dynamic compiler.

    $ make hue
    $ build/bin/hue --help
    $ build/bin/hue test/test_lang_data_literals.hue
    Hello World
    Hello World
    $ build/bin/hue -output-ir=- -compile-only test/test_lang_data_literals.hue
    # IR code here...
    $ build/bin/hue -parse-only test/test_lang_data_literals.hue
    # AST repr here...

You could chain hue with llvm tools to compile a machine image:

    $ build/bin/hue -output-ir=- -compile-only test/test_lang_data_literals.hue \
      | llvm-as -o=- | llvm-ld -native -Lbuild/lib -lhuert -o=program -
    $ ./program
    Hello World
    Hello World

If you don't have a local llvm installation, you might need to add the llvm bin directory from deps to your PATH environment variable before running the above.

    PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/deps/llvm/bin/bin


## Objectives and plans

1. Have fun
2. Take is slowly and go bottom-up, analyzing machine code and drinking coffee
3. Functions that can capture its environment
4. Complex types (records/structs/et al) with automatic reference counting
5. Listen to Black Sabbath and take over the worlds

Seriously, this is just for fun. Don't expect anything from this project.
